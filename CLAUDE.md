First, think about the problem, read the codebase to find relevant files, and write a plan in tasks/todo.md.
The plan should have a list of tasks that you can mark as completed.
Before starting work, contact me and I will review the plan.
Then, start working on the tasks, marking them as completed as you progress.
Please, at each step of the way, just give me a detailed explanation of the changes you made.
Make each task and code change as simple as possible. We want to avoid massive or complex changes. Each change should impact the code as minimally as possible. It all comes down to simplicity.
Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes made and any other relevant information.
