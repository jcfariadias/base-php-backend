# Backend Foundation 3: Docker Containerization Setup

## Task Overview
Implement and verify Docker containerization setup with PHP-FPM, Nginx, and PostgreSQL for the Symfony DDD architecture.

## Tasks

### 1. Docker Setup Review and Analysis
- [ ] Review current Docker Compose configuration
- [ ] Analyze Dockerfile for PHP-FPM optimization
- [ ] Examine Nginx configuration for production readiness
- [ ] Verify PostgreSQL setup and version compatibility
- [ ] Check volume mappings and data persistence

### 2. DDD Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Verify Docker setup supports DDD layered architecture
- [ ] Check if container structure aligns with src/ directory organization
- [ ] Ensure proper separation of concerns in containerization
- [ ] Validate that containers don't break architecture principles

### 3. Production Readiness Optimization
- [ ] Optimize Dockerfile for production build
- [ ] Enhance Nginx configuration for performance and security
- [ ] Optimize PostgreSQL configuration for performance
- [ ] Add health checks for all services
- [ ] Implement proper restart policies

### 4. Network and Security Configuration
- [ ] Verify inter-container communication
- [ ] Check network isolation and security
- [ ] Validate SSL/TLS readiness
- [ ] Ensure proper secrets management
- [ ] Configure firewall rules if needed

### 5. Volume and Data Management
- [ ] Verify persistent data storage
- [ ] Optimize volume mappings for development vs production
- [ ] Ensure proper file permissions
- [ ] Configure backup strategies for database
- [ ] Test data persistence across container restarts

### 6. Container Orchestration Testing
- [ ] Test container startup order and dependencies
- [ ] Verify service discovery and communication
- [ ] Test container scaling capabilities
- [ ] Validate graceful shutdown procedures
- [ ] Check resource limits and constraints

### 7. Development Experience Enhancement
- [ ] Optimize Docker Compose for development workflow
- [ ] Add development tools and debugging capabilities
- [ ] Configure hot reload for development
- [ ] Add convenience scripts for common operations
- [ ] Ensure fast rebuild times

### 8. Documentation and Validation
- [ ] Update Docker documentation
- [ ] Create Docker troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Verify all services are accessible
- [ ] Test complete application startup
- [ ] Validate database connectivity and migrations

## Acceptance Criteria

- All containers start successfully and communicate properly
- Nginx serves Symfony application correctly
- PostgreSQL is accessible and supports required features
- Docker setup is production-ready with proper security
- Development workflow is smooth and efficient
- All services have proper health checks and monitoring
- Documentation is complete and accurate

## Notes

- Follow existing architecture patterns in architecture.md
- Ensure minimal changes to existing working setup
- Focus on optimization and production readiness
- Maintain compatibility with DDD structure
