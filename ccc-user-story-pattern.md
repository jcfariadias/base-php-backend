# Card Conversation Confirmation (CCC) User Story Pattern

## Format Structure

**Card**
**AS A** [user type | role],
**I WANT** [functionality],
**SO THAT I** [benefit]

**Conversation**
[Small, no straight to the point definition of why the story is important]

**Confirmation**
[Acceptance Criteria - Numbered by order of priority of implementation. Each criterion should be straight to the point of what it wants, not BDD-like patterns]

## Example

**Card:**
**AS A** project manager,
**I WANT** to create visual workflow boards,
**SO THAT I** can track project progress and team productivity

**Conversation:**
Visual workflow management is essential for maintaining team alignment and identifying bottlenecks in project delivery. This feature addresses the core need for transparent project tracking.

**Confirmation:**

1. Create new workflow board with title and description
2. Add customizable columns (To Do, In Progress, Done, etc.)
3. Create, edit, and delete cards within columns
4. Drag and drop cards between columns
5. Assign team members to cards
6. Set due dates for cards
7. Add priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
8. Real-time updates visible to all team members
9. Board sharing and permission settings
10. Archive completed boards
