./docs/deployment/security-considerations.md

# 3. Set up comprehensive monitoring
./docs/deployment/monitoring-observability.md

# 4. Configure advanced CI/CD
./docs/deployment/ci-cd-pipelines.md

# 5. Monthly cost: $500-2000+
```

## 🎯 Platform Decision Matrix

| Priority | Recommended Platform | Setup Time | Monthly Cost | Complexity |
|----------|---------------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| **Speed** | Railway → DigitalOcean | 10-30 min | $35-60 | Low |
| **Cost** | VPS → Railway → DigitalOcean | 30-60 min | $20-60 | Low-Medium |
| **Scale** | Google Cloud Run → Kubernetes | 1-4 hours | $100-500+ | Medium-High |
| **Enterprise** | Kubernetes → AWS ECS | 1-2 days | $500-2000+ | High |

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Your Application Stack
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Nginx Proxy   │ ← SSL termination, load balancing
├─────────────────┤
│  Symfony App    │ ← PHP 8.4, JWT auth, business logic
├─────────────────┤
│  PostgreSQL 15  │ ← Primary database
├─────────────────┤
│    Redis 7      │ ← Sessions, caching
└─────────────────┘
```

### Deployment Environments

## 📊 Cost Estimates by Scale

### Startup Scale (< 1K daily users)
- **DigitalOcean**: $42/month (app + database + Redis)
- **Railway**: $35/month (hobby plan + databases)
- **VPS + Docker**: $20/month (self-managed)

### Growth Scale (1K-10K daily users)
- **Google Cloud Run**: $100-200/month (usage-based)
- **DigitalOcean**: $100-150/month (scaled resources)
- **AWS ECS**: $150-300/month (Fargate + databases)

### Enterprise Scale (10K+ daily users)
- **Kubernetes**: $500-2000/month (managed + resources)
- **AWS ECS**: $500-1500/month (EC2 + managed services)
- **Multi-cloud**: $1000+/month (redundancy + compliance)

## 🔐 Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Secrets Management**: JWT keys, database passwords, API keys
- [ ] **SSL/TLS**: HTTPS everywhere, security headers configured
- [ ] **Network Security**: Firewall rules, private networks
- [ ] **Access Control**: IAM roles, principle of least privilege
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Security event logging, intrusion detection
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Automated backups, disaster recovery plan

## 📈 Monitoring Essentials

Essential metrics to monitor:

### Application Metrics
- Response time (< 500ms target)
- Error rate (< 1% target)
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Database query performance

### Infrastructure Metrics
- CPU usage (< 70% sustained)
- Memory usage (< 80% sustained)
- Disk usage (< 85% capacity)
- Network latency

### Business Metrics
- User registrations
- Authentication success rate
- API endpoint usage
- Feature adoption rates

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Deployment Rollback Procedure
```bash
# 1. Identify issue
kubectl get pods -n warehouse

# 2. Check application logs
kubectl logs deployment/warehouse-app -n warehouse

# 3. Rollback if necessary
kubectl rollout undo deployment/warehouse-app -n warehouse

# 4. Verify rollback
curl https://your-domain.com/health
```

### Emergency Contacts
- **Platform Support**: Keep support contact information readily available
- **Team Escalation**: Define who to contact for different types of issues
- **Monitoring Alerts**: Configure alerts for critical thresholds

## 🔄 Maintenance Windows

### Recommended Maintenance Schedule
- **Security Updates**: Weekly during low-traffic periods
- **Feature Deployments**: Bi-weekly or sprint-based
- **Infrastructure Updates**: Monthly with proper testing
- **Database Maintenance**: Quarterly with backup verification

### Zero-Downtime Strategies
- Use blue-green deployments for major updates
- Implement database migrations that are backward compatible
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Monitor continuously during deployments
